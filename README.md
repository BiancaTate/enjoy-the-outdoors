# enjoy-the-outdoors
This webiste is the second Capstone project for Year Up's Learn to Code Academy for Fall 2023. We were instructed to create a website that helps a user find things to do to enjoy in the great outdoors. 
We were provided with JS files containing data relevant to our websites. The files contained information about various national paarks and mountains. 
Using the provided data, html, CSS and JS, I have created a responsive site that allows the user to view mountain information based on which name they choose from a dropdown menu. The user is also able to search view national parks based on location or park type filters. There is also a view all parks option.Some parks also have websites that the user may view in a different tab upon clicking on the link  
The user is able to access all of these pages via a bootstrap navigation bar and from links included on the home page. 
There are hues of brown and white to help foster the Outdoors theme of the website. 
I beleive the option to visit a specific park's website that only appears if the website exists is the most interesting piece of code that I have written. It includes if conditions inside of for loops.
